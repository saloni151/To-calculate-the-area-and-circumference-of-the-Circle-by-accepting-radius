# To-calculate-the-area-and-circumference-of-the-Circle-by-accepting-radius

**Problem statement: Write a Python program that will calculate the area and circumference of a Circle by accepting the radius.**

# Circle Area and Circumference Calculator 

This is a simple Python program that calculates the **Area** and **Circumference** of a circle by accepting the radius as input from the user.

# Formulas Used

- **Area** = π × r²  
- **Circumference** = 2 × π × r  
  > Where `r` is the radius of the circle and π is approximately 3.1416.

**In a Python program, use math.pi after importing the math module.**
- import math.pi
- **Area** = math.pi *r**2 
- **Circumference** = 2 * math.pi * r
